link:https://kustomize.io/[Kustomize] traverses a Kubernetes manifest to add, remove or update configuration options without forking. It is available both as a standalone binary and as a native feature of `kubectl` (and by extension `oc`). 

The principals of `kustomize` are:

* Purely declarative approach to configuration customization 
* Manage an arbitrary number of distinctly customized Kubernetes configurations 
* Every artifact that kustomize uses is plain YAML and can be validated and processed as such 
* As a "templateless" templating system; it encourages using YAML without forking the repo.

== Exploring the Kustomize CLI

The `kustomize` CLI should have been installed as part of the lab
setup. Verify that it has been installed.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize version --short
----


This should display the version, it should look something like this.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
{kustomize/v4.0.5  2021-02-13T21:21:14Z  }
----


Kustomize, at it's core, is meant to build native Kubernetes manifests
based on YAML, while leaving the original YAML intact. It achieves this
in a "template-less" templating format. This is done by providing a `kustomization.yaml` file.

We will be focusing on two sub-commands the `build` command and the
`edit` command.

The `build` command takes the YAML source (via a path or URL) and creates
a new YAML that can be piped into `kubectl create`. We will work with
an example in the `documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/kustomize-build` directory.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/kustomize-build
----

Here you should see two files, a `kustomization.yaml` file and a `welcome.yaml` file, let's have a look at them.

.link:[welcome.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$kustomize-build/welcome.yaml[]
----

This file shows nothing special. Just a standard Kubernetes manifest.

What if, for example, we wanted to add a `label` to this manifest without editing it? This is where the `kustomization.yaml` file comes in.

.link:[kustomization.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$kustomize-build/kustomization.yaml[]
----

As you can see in the output there isn't much. The two sections for this
example are the `resources` and the `patchesJson6902` sections.

`resources` is an array of individual files, directories, and/or URLs where other manifests are stored. In this example we are just loading in one file. The (https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/patchesjson6902/[`patchesJson6902` is a patching RFC] that `kustomize` supports. As you can see, in the `patchesJson6902` file, I am adding a label to this manifest.

> **NOTE** You can read about what options are available for patching in the https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/[official documentation site]

Build this manifest by running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize build
----

You can see that the new label got added to the manifest!

[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: welcome-php
    testkey: testvalue
  name: welcome-php
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: welcome-php
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: welcome-php
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php:ffcd15
        name: welcome-php
        resources: {}
----

You can use the `kustomize edit` command instead of writing YAML. For
example, you can change the image tag this `Deployment` uses from `latest`
to `ffcd15` by running the following:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize edit set image quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php:ffcd15
----

This will update the `kustomization.yaml` file with a `images` section. 
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cat kustomization.yaml
----

[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- ./welcome.yaml
patchesJson6902:
- patch: |-
    - op: add
      path: /metadata/labels/testkey
      value: testvalue
  target:
    group: apps
    kind: Deployment
    name: welcome-php
    version: v1
images:
- name: quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php
  newTag: ffcd15
----

Now when you run:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
 kustomize build .
----

You should see not only the new label but also the new `ffcd15` image tag.

> **NOTE** You may have to close the `kustomization.yaml` tab and re-open it to see the changes.

You can see how you can take already existing YAML and modify it for
your specific environment without the need to copy or edit the original.

Kustomize can be used to write a new YAML file or be piped into
the `kubectl` (or `oc`) command. Example:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
----

[#exploring_kustomize_with_kubectl]
=== Exploring Kustomize with Kubectl

Since Kubernetes 1.14, The `kubectl` command (and by extension the
`oc` cli) has support for Kustomize built in.

You can see this by running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl kustomize --help
----

This runs the `kustomize build` command. You can see this by running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl kustomize
----

Although you can use this to pipe it into the apply command, you
don't have to. The `kubectl apply` command has the `-k` option that
will run the build before it applies the manifest.

To test this out, first create a namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl create namespace kustomize-test
----

Next make sure you're on the namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=kustomize-test
----

--
OpenShift::
+
--
To test this out, first create a project:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc new-project kustomize-test
----

Next make sure you're on the project: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc project kustomize-test
----

--
====


Finally run the command to build and apply the manifests:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl apply -k ./
----

> **NOTE** You can pass not only directories, but URLs as well. The
> only requirement is that you have a `kustomization.yaml` file in
> the path.

This should create the deployment and you should see the pods running in the namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl get pods -n kustomize-test
----

You can see the deployment was created with the additional labels:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl get deployment welcome-php -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' | jq -r
----

Also, the image was updated based on the customization that was made:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl get deploy welcome-php  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[].image}{"\n"}'
----

As you can see `kustomize` can be a powerful tool.


[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====
Minikube::

You can now safely delete this namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl delete namespace kustomize-test
----

--
OpenShift::

--
If you want, you can now delete this project as we won't use it for next steps

[#deploying_kustomized_application]
== Deploying Kustomized Application

In previous chapter, you learned that in a GitOps workflow; the
entire application stack (including infrastructure) is reflected
in a git repo. The challenge is how to do this without duplicating
YAML.

So now that you've explored `kustomize`, let's see how it fits into Argo
CD and how it can be used in a GitOps workflow.

Before preceeding, move back into the home directory:

[#kustomized_application]
=== Kustomized Application

Argo CD has native support for Kustomize. You can use this to avoid
duplicating YAML for each deployment. This is especially good to
use if you have different environments or clusters you're deploying
to.

Take a look at the `Application` definition:

This is using a concept of an "overlay", where you have a "base"
set of manifests and you overlay your customizations.

Take a look at the `kustomization.yaml` file:

    patch: |-
      - op: replace
        path: /spec/rules/0/host
        value: bgdk.devnation
----

This `kustomization.yaml` take the base application and patches the
manifest so that we get a yellow square instead of a blue one. It
also deploys the application to the `bgdk` namespace (denoted by
the `namespace:` section of the file) and update the Ingress hostname for this new namespace to be `bgdk.devnation`.

Add Minikube IP (`minikube ip`) and the Ingress hostname `bgdk.devnation` to your Host file, like `/etc/hosts`.

As you can see, the application deployed with your customizations! To review what we just did.

* Deployed an Application called `bgd` with a blue square.
* Deployed another Application based on `bgd` called `bgdk`
* The Application `bgdk` was deployed in it's own namespace, with deployment customizations.
* ALL without having to duplicate YAML!
